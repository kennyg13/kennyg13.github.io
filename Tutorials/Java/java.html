				<h3>Start for Java - Syntax and Classes</h3>
				<p>And we're off! Okay so the first thing you need to understand is how a java file looks and functions.
				 I know it's boring but it's important and I won't take to much time on it. So a java file usually looks like
				 this, the way the text is colored depends on what text editor you are using. To create a file from scratch just 
				 go on your text editor and add what's below and name it Java.java, I do however suggest you download Eclipse Luna(It's free
				 , easiest way to edit java files, allows you test them out, and automatically creates all the files you would need to create 
				 if you were to do it alone)
				</p>
				<img src="Images/syntax.jpg" class="syntax"/>
				<p>
				This is a java class called "Java", if you were to create one on eclipse it will automatically create the basic structure
				for you; however, if you are doing it on a text editor know that you need to have the name matching the class. Notice how the
				Java.java file has the class called Java and that class alone, no other classes. Where it says <strong>public static void main(String[] args)</strong>
				 don't really pay attention to right now just acknowledge that this is a method called main. When you compile your class to a .jar file
				  it will look for this method to run. When you create a project in eclipse the folders will look like this and they will all be in the
				  folder with the name of the project you created. Your Java.java class will be in the <strong>src</strong> folder
				</p>

				<h3>Lesson 1 - Declaring Variables and Methods</h3>
				<img src="Images/variables.jpg" class="syntax"/>
				<p>Now to actually learning to program, there are three variables in this Java class, 
				these three are the basics, which are basically
				objects that hold certain information. Just know to close a variable you need to end it with a <strong>;</strong>
				So the <strong>int a = 1;</strong> is holding the whole number 1 and 
				it's type is integer(Whole Number). <br><br>
				<strong>String b = "Kenneth"</strong> is a String variable which holds word(s), declared by using its type <strong>String</strong>
				naming the variable whatever you like as long as its not a number, in this case <strong>b</strong> and hold the string <strong>Kenneth</strong>
				be sure though to have the quotes around the word you want your variable to hold or else it won't work and you'll get an error.
				<br><br>
				<strong>boolean c = false;</strong> is a boolean variable which holds either <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. This variable
				is called <strong>c</strong> and holds <strong>false</strong>
				<br><br>Now I'm going to show you how to create a method that will help things go a lot quicker. A method is something that 
				holds functionallity(Code that does something), you can then use that method to manipulate variables or do certain things
				now the method I created is <strong>public static void print(Object a)</strong> and the opening and closing brackets 
				contain the functionallity that allows me do something, without them you'll get an error.
				</p>
				<img src="Images/print.jpg" class="syntax"/>
				<p>Now the part where it says <strong>print(Object a)</strong> means that when I tell
				the computer to do whatever is inside the method <strong>print</strong> I can give it a variable to manipulate.
				 That variable is type Object(Any variable) and is called <strong>a</strong>. How do you tell the program to run
				 the method <strong>print</strong>? By calling it and all you have to do to call a method is state it's name and
				 <strong>pass</strong> in the variable it asks for like on line 6 in the Java.java class.  
				</p>
				<img src="Images/call.jpg" class="syntax"/>
				<p>I am calling <strong>print(Object a)</strong> and passing in the String <strong>Kenneth</strong>
				 what this allows me to do is use the variable in the method print, where as I couldn't before. Now that I have passed
				 the variable <strong>b</strong> into <strong>print</strong> it is no longer known as b but as <strong>a</strong> because
				 that is the name of the variable in the <strong>parameter</strong> of the method print(Object <strong>a</strong>). When
				 I manipulate the variable <strong>a</strong> it doesn't change the String <strong>b</strong> because right now
				  there is now way for me to save it back to the <strong>main</strong> method.
